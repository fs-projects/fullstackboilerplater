This is a node.js application that is deployed on heroku via github code base that lies here. There is a continuous integration pipeline setup that has been done to manage the changes here in code base and subsequent deployments in heroku. 
Any other user other that is NOT 'fs-projects', has to create a pull request in a new branch and then commit the changes with proper comments. The commit will be reviewed by 'fs-projects' before it is merged to master branch. Once merged to master, the change will be automatically deployed to heroku in staging app, after which it will be tested and post that changes will be moved to production.
